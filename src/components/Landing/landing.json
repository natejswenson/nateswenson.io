    "description":"Learn to create your own minimalist wallet in this Leathercrafting 101 course. Students will use one of many designs offered while learning the processes of creating a wallet from start to finish. Students will start by tracing their design onto the leather, cut out the design, sew the wallet according to template specifications and finish the edge of the wallet with beeswax. The best part; every time you reach for your wallet, you will be reminded of your awesome work! This class is a great introduction to leatherworking, welcome to men, women and children ages 16+.",
